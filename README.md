Power measurement with Fluke 96270A and R&amp;S NRPZ55 power sensor.


In the first page, connections are being checked in the simple way.

And in the second page you are taking measurements step by step.

Finally you get the measurement results on Excel by clicking Finish button.


In our laboratory, we need these measurement points,so i created the measurement page no-editable.
